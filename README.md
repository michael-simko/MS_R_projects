# MS_R_projects
This repo is a portfolio of my data science work using R. It includes R-markdown files and summarized outputs in html format. These projects show examples of data cleansing and munging, feature engineering, classification and regression modeling and visualization techniques. 

The ArcticSeaIce files show analysis of historical arctic sea ice values and work done using R and R Markdown. These projects show simple visualization and data characterization techniques, data cleaning and time series analysis.

The sonar files use R and the caret package to build a variety of models and check their accuracy.

Grains is a time series with boxplots and heatmaps to show price volatility and fluctuations.

The wifi files are also apply feature engineering and modeling to develop a wifi locationing system.

Submeters is an R-Markdown file with code analyzing a large dataset of household electrical observations. After feature engineering and data munging, the code creates visualizations of sub-meter values day to day over the period of one year.

breastcancerclassification is a project that classifies a diagnosis of benign or malignant based on a number of mass characteristics.

I was turned on to calculating Collatz Conjecture string lengths using Python, and wanted to try the same exercise using R. In my experiene, with this code structure, python is significantly faster. However, I think there may be ways to improve the code to improve speed. However, I've added my first successful attempt to calculate Collatz string lengths with R.
