# MSprojects
This repo is my portfolio of data science work using Python and R. It includes Jupyter notebooks, R-markdown files and summarized outputs. These projects show data cleansing and munging, feature engineering, classification and regression modeling and visualization techniques. 

The ASI files show analysis of arctic sea ice values and work done with R.

The sonar files explore using R and the caret package to build models with the sonar dataset

The wifi files are also R and apply feature engineering and modeling to develop a wifi locationing system.

Work on a database of credit default rates (Credit One files) to perform EDA and modeling was also completed in Jupyter Notebook using Python.

The radmodel file is a Jupyter notebook using Python to visualize solar radiation observations over time, and a few models to predict solar radiation values based on weather conditions.

submeters is an r-markdown file with code analyzing a large dataset of electrical observations. This code creates visualizations of sub-meter values day to day over the period of one year.
