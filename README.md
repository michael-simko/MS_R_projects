# MSprojects
This repo is my portfolio of data science work using Python and R. It includes Jupyter notebooks, R-markdown files and summarized outputs	. The projects show data cleansing and munging, feature engineering, classification and regression modeling and visualization techniques. 
The ASI files show analysis of arctic sea ice values and work done with R.
The sonar files explore using R and the caret package to build some models with the sonar dataset
The wifi files are also R and apply feature engineering and modeling to develop a wifi locationing system.
