# MSprojects
This repo is my portfolio of data science work using Python and R. It includes Jupyter notebooks, R-markdown files and summarized outputs in html format. These projects show examples of data cleansing and munging, feature engineering, classification and regression modeling and visualization techniques. 

The ASI files show analysis of arctic sea ice values and work done using R and R Markdown.

The sonar files use R and the caret package to build models.

Grains is a time series with boxplots and heatmaps to show price volatility and fluctuations.

The wifi files are also R and apply feature engineering and modeling to develop a wifi locationing system.

Credit default rates (Credit One files) were analyzed using EDA techniques and modeling and was acompleted in Jupyter Notebook using Python.

The radmodel file is a Jupyter Notebook using Python to visualize solar radiation observations over time, and a few models to predict solar radiation values based on weather conditions.

Submeters is an R-Markdown file with code analyzing a large dataset of electrical observations. After feature engineering and data munging, the code creates visualizations of sub-meter values day to day over the period of one year.
